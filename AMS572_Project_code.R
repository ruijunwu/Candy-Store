# Description: 

# Whatâ€™s the best (or at least the most popular) Halloween candy? That was the question 
# this dataset was collected to answer. Data was collected by creating a website where 
# participants were shown presenting two fun-sized candies and asked to click on the one 
# they would prefer to receive. In total, more than 269 thousand votes were collected 
# from 8,371 different IP addresses.

# N = 85.

# The data contains the following fields: 
#   chocolate: Does it contain chocolate?
#   fruity: Is it fruit flavored?
#   caramel: Is there caramel in the candy?
#   peanutalmondy: Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?
#   nougat: Does it contain nougat?
#   crispedricewafer: Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?
#   hard: Is it a hard candy?
#   bar: Is it a candy bar?
#   pluribus: Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?
#   sugarpercent: The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set.
#   pricepercent: The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set.
#   winpercent: The overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups.


# For binary variables, 1 means yes, 0 means no.

#--------------------------Proportional Test Added-------11/02/2018----------------------------------

#Hypothesis 1

#Among the candies with winpercent greater than 50, the proportion of chocolate is greater than fruity

#H0: p.chocolate = p.fruity
#H1: p.chocolate > p.fruity

#First we extract data with winpercent greater than 50:
high_win = candy_data[which(candy_data$winpercent>50),]

#Then we collect the chocolate and fruity columns:
high_win_chocolate = high_win$chocolate
high_win_fruity = high_win$fruity

#Set up the parameters needed for the proportion test:
#Sample size of chocolate (n1):
nc = length(high_win_chocolate)
#Sample size of fruity (n2):
nf = length(high_win_fruity)
#Size of chocolate = 1:
xc = length(high_win_chocolate[which(high_win_chocolate==1)])
#Size of fruity = 1:
xf = length(high_win_fruity[which(high_win_fruity==1)])
#Proportion of chocolate (p1):
p.chocolate = xc/nc
#Proportion of fruity (p2):
p.fruity = xf/nf

#Do the proportion test with alpha = 0.05:
prop.test(x = c(xc, xf), n = c(nc, nf), alternative = "greater", conf.level = 0.95)

#The test gives a p.value = 0.0001454, which is extremely small, so we reject H0 and conclude that
#candies with chocolate has larger proportion than fruity candies among the "popular" candies.



#__________________________________________________________________________


#--------------------------------Equal Mean Test Added------11/08/2018------------------------------------

#Hypothesis 2

#We are interested in comparing the sugar amount between candies with different ingredients.
#We would like to check if chocolate candies contains less sugar than the caramel candies.

#H0: mu.chocolate = mu.caramel
#H1: mu.chocolate < mu.caramel

#First we extract the data of chocolate and fruity candies into two groups:
chocolate_test2 = candy_data[which(candy_data$chocolate == 1),]
caramel_test2 = candy_data[which(candy_data$caramel == 1),]

#Then we get the corresponding sugar percentages:
chocolate_sugar = chocolate_test2$sugarpercent
caramel_sugar = caramel_test2$sugarpercent

#Test normality
shapiro.test(chocolate_sugar)
shapiro.test(caramel_sugar)
#test the variance
var.test(chocolate_sugar,caramel_sugar,ratio=1, conf.level = 0.95)

#Perform a pooled-variance t-test:
t.test(chocolate_sugar, caramel_sugar, alternative = 'less', mu=0, conf.level = 0.95,var.equal = TRUE)
#The test gives a p-value = 0.0784, so we do not reject H0 and conclude that there is not enough evidence
#which shows that chocolate candies contain more sugar than caramel candies.



#__________________________________________________________________________

# Hypothesis 3:

# Whether a candy is a bar, whether a candy is fruity and overall win percentage are good predictors of whether the candy contains chocolate or not.

# Let's apply Generalized Linear Model to analyse this question. 

# First, let's convert binary variables to factors
candy_data$chocolate <- factor(candy_data$chocolate)
candy_data$fruity <- factor(candy_data$fruity)
candy_data$bar <- factor(candy_data$bar)

# Construct GLE model
chocolate_model <- glm(chocolate ~ bar + fruity + winpercent, 
                           data = candy_data, family = "binomial")
summary(chocolate_model)


# To assess explained variation we will use McFadden's pseudo-R squared. 

# Construct GLE null model
chocolate_predictor_null <- glm(chocolate ~ 1, data = candy_data, family="binomial")

#  McFadden's pseudo-R squared is equal to 0.7293682
1 - logLik(chocolate_model) / logLik(chocolate_predictor_null)

# Since pseudo-R squared is rather high, it is reasonable to conclude that the information 
# about whether a candy is a bar, whether a candy is a fruity, and overall win percentage 
# is a good predictors of whether the candy contains chocolate or not.
